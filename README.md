Protein is one of the major building blocks of the human body. It builds and maintains tissue. Chemically, it is composed of amino acids – organic compounds made of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen or sulphur.
Proteins carry out almost all fundamental biological processes essential for life by folding themselves into accurate three-dimensional structures that control their interaction with other molecules.
Since the shape of a protein determines its function and role in various diseases, it is important to study and predict their structures to develop life-saving and life-changing medicines.
However, it is not as easy as it sounds. Over the last 5 decades, protein folding has remained one of the most challenging problems for biochemists. Numerous computational methods have been developed, especially in recent years, to predict how proteins fold but an explicit sequence-to-structure map hasn’t been achieved yet.
